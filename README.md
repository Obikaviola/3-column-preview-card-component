### What I learned

From this challenge, I was able to learn how to add Google fonts to my code. First, I had to import the url to the html (could be done either by adding the url to the styles or the html code). Then I had to add the styles with the **.lexend-deca-regular** class. Both the url and the styles were provided by Google fonts.

```html
 <style>
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Big+Shoulders+Display:wght@700&family=Lexend+Deca&display=swap')
</style>
```

```css
.lexend-deca-regular {
  font-family: "Lexend Deca", sans-serif;
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}
```
